2. Afer clonning to my computer, i opened the repo with VS code. Copied the Assets folder and html file provided to the repos i opened in the vs code.
3. I initiated the first commit of the repo by typing the command git add on my terminal to add the changes i made, git commit to commit it to the local repository and git push to push it to the remote reository in my github account.
4. To make the site more accessible, i added semantic structure of 'header','main' 'footet','nav','aside' and 'section' tags by changing all the 'div' tag under header to 'header' tag and 'nav' tag respectively. I commited changes i made by following the third step of the process.
5. I repeated the process four (4) for commits 3,4 and 5 in the repository in my github account.
